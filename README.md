Blockrate Binaries
==================

A formalization of the powswap protocol, blockrate binaries. Blockrate binaries
enable hedging against energy fluctuations and changes in the hashrate production
with pure Bitcoin native contracts. The contracts are trustless and rely solely
on Script primitives. They can be deployed today with no consensus changes.
